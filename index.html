        <h3> BCHacks2020: 2nd place</h3>
        <p>Perfect way to start my last term at UBC! </p>
        <p> My team and I developed a website that shows the requirements to take any Computer Science course
          in an easier way for students, all this in just 24hrs.</p>
          <p> These were some of the tools we used: beautiful-soup for web scrapping, python for the data formattinf, mermaid markdown,
            sentiment analysis and jquery. Here it is: <a href="http://www.buildapool.space"> buildapool.space </a></p>

            <h3>Research Assistant at the Advanced Thermo-Fluidic Laboratory</h3>
            <p> I was a research assistant for around two years in this lab! I started with pretty simple tasks but at the end I ended up working
              on my own research project.</p>
              <p> This included doing prototypes using Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and lots of different sensors from Adafruit (this was definitely my
                favourite part of the project) and user interfaces for these using python! </p>

                <h3>Western Engineering Competition</h3>
                <p> My team and I participated in the Okanagan and Western Engineering Competition. We had the amazing opportunity to travel to Winnipeg in
                  January for the second one (which was very cold). For both competitions we had to develop a sort of game, and for both cases we used Unity.

                <h3>HackArizona</h3>
                <p> For this one my team and I travelled all the way from Kelowna to the University of Arizona. We developed a hardware and software prototype
                  for a device focused on the userâ€™s safety index based on location, in only 24 hours. </p>

                <h3>Start-up Intern Yacare Tech Ecuador</h3>
                <p> I would say this is where my love for prototyping started. When I was in high school I started volunteering for this startup near my highschool.
                  When I went back to Ecuador for the summer after my first and second year I worked as an intern for them! I built lots of prototypes, even Solidworks
                  models that later became the casing for some of the products.</p>
                  <p> I know its not a Google internship but to me it felt like it! It was one of the most important projects I've been a part of</p>
